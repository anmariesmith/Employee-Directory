While in class, we needed to build an employee directory that would add a new contact, delete a contact, verify a name on the contact list, and update a current contact all while dynamically updating the page in a single page application format. 

Some problems I ran into were with the verify and update functions- after several hours troubleshooting it I was able to figure it out and of course the solution was simple in that I didn't close the conditionals properly under the loop so it would continue to loop through and give me 6 false values and 1 true value in 7 loops. 

I really enjoyed this project and felt my understanding of Javascript became much stronger with this activity.
